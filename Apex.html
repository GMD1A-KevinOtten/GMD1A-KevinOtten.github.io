							<u><b>The Game</b></u>
							</font>

							<b2>
							<p>
							<br>Apex is suposed to be a linear Virtual Reality escape room.
							The idea of the assignment was to make a Virtual Reality escape room with Professor Layton difficulty puzzles.
							We decided to make it a Space theme where you play as a test monkey on a space ship and you needed to get to a escape pod.
							Because of distractions making the game, testing puzzle ideas and vr related things we put less time in the escape room feeling and the game ended up being more of a puzzle room than a escape room.
							Other requirements that we had to put in for the assignment was that the player could not die or lose to a timer.
							We did decide to add a count up timer to keep track of how long the player was playing for.
							In the end the game became a pretty fun Virtual Reality puzzle room experience in a decent looking Space setting.

							<u><b>ProgressionSystem</b></u>
							</font>

							<b2>
							<p><img src="images/ApexPage02.gif" class="image2" alt="Gif missing" style="margin-top:42px; margin-right:15px;">
							<br>The progression system pushes the player to progress in the game down a linear line.
							This system uses voice lines combined with the unlocking of the next puzzle to inform the player of what to do next.
							The audio works by playing the audio clips placed in order within a list, waiting for one voice line to finish before starting the next one.
							These list are placed in scriptable objects which themselves are placed in a list whiting the FlowManager.
							The Progression System works with start and end functions for all game steps making the game flow as intended but the code less than desirable.
							In hindsight I would have made one or two functions that could have been called with the necessary information to properly move on to the next step in the games flow.

							<u><b>WorldspaceUI & Options</b></u>
							</font>

							<b2>
							<p><img src="images/ApexPage03.gif" class="image2" alt="Gif missing" style="margin-top:42px; margin-right:15px;">
							<br>All worldspace UI in the scene Uses a shader I edited to make it have a oldTech feeling like in alien isolation.
							The UI I made shows the settings of the game.
							These settings are: Sound, Graphics and movement type.
							Besides this there is also a reset button, switch hands button and a hints screen.
							The options are controlled by buttons for the reset, switch hand and movement type options, A handle for the Quality options and a slider for the Sound.
							The movement switches between teleportation and free movement.
							The reset button resets the scene in case the player want to start over.
							The Quality handel rotates between a minimum and maximum distance and uses a vector3.distance to check how far along it is and from there what quality setting it should be on.
							The Sound slider does pretty much the same thing as the Quality handel accept that it uses its local position with the distance to calculate the sound value.
							All sound and quality settings give their values to the SettingsManager which then changes the actual values to those given by the individual sliders and handels.

							<u><b>FreeMovement Restrictions</b></u>
							</font>

							<b2>
							<p><img src="images/ApexPage04.jpg" class="image2" alt="" style="margin-top:42px; margin-right:15px;"/>
							<br>The Free Movement Restrictions use the VR movement system made before the project by our lead developer.
							It restricts The free movement stopping the player from moving into a Big object like a table.
							It does this by shooting a raycast towards the ground from the next position of your VR goggles.
							If it hits one of the colliders setup in the walls and static big objects in the scene the player wont move.
							If it does not detect this the player will move towards the direction.
							If a otherwise static object moves because of an animation the colider instead of being put in the main group of colliders is placed on the object so it moves whit the object and properly stops movement on its new posision.
